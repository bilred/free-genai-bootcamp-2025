        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

        <vocabulary>
            <word>
                <native>bear</native>
                <ipa>/bɛər/</ipa>
                <meaning>A large wild animal</meaning>
            </word>
            <word>
                <native>door</native>
                <ipa>/dɔːr/</ipa>
                <meaning>An entrance to a building</meaning>
            </word>
            <word>
                <native>garbage</native>
                <ipa>/ˈɡɑːr.bɪdʒ/</ipa>
                <meaning>Waste or trash</meaning>
            </word>
            <word>
                <native>leave</native>
                <ipa>/liːv/</ipa>
                <meaning>To abandon or forget something</meaning>
            </word>
        </vocabulary>

        Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: 
        "Bears are at the door" and "Did you leave the garbage out?" 

        For the first clause, we need a verb that expresses existence.
        For the second clause, we need a past-tense verb form.

        <sentence_structure>
            [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
        </sentence_structure>

        Your turn! Try filling in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided.
